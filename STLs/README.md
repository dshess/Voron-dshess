# Longer DIN Rail

Modelled after the stubs in the V0.2 printed parts.  I bolted it on
the back-middle bolts (TODO: picture).  The bolt channels are offset
so you can get a bit of vertical adjustment by flipping 180 degrees.
The channels to give a bit of left-right adjustment.  I think I just
went with the +2mm or +4mm bolt size from whatever the manual says.

Print in the same orientation as the normal STLs, which I think means
on the face the bolts come from.  Printing on the back face cause
fitment issues for me.  I printed with supports, which worked
... adequately, I have to bust them out from the back, but it was
fine.  (TODO: rework to either not use head insets, or to include
integrated supports, or to do Prusa-style bridging tricks).
